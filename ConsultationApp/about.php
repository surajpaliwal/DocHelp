        <p style="color: white">The DocHelp is Online Docter Pautent consultation system which is an end user support and online consultation project. Here we propose a system that connects patients to available doctors for online consultation . Our proposed system aims to build an environment where various patients needing doctor help at their home can consult doctors, send their images(for skin diseases/beauty related issues), chat with doctors, tell then their issues and discuss remedies. It also consists of a doctors login panel where doctor may login to the system and then see patient requests for consultations. The system then schedules those requests and serves them to doctor one after another. This allows doctors to chat with patients and discuss their problems. The system will prove helpful to urgent cases that do not reach hospital, for emergency cases that do not have doctors in area, during late night emergencies and also for preliminary examination of patients.
